# Movies
In this Jupyter Notebook, I was trying to analyze the relationship between movies and other factors such as gross revenue and movie scores. The primary dataset used as the base of this project consists of movies data from IMDb.com for 1980-2020. The methods used include linear regression and polynomial regression. The main libraries used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, statsmodels, and scipy. Also, I identified the most successful production companies, genres, and countries for the indicated period.
